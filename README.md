# Maazim 

This repository contains the source code for the **Maazim project**, as part of the **SWE444 - Software Construction Laboratory** course.

Built with **Flutter** and powered by **Firebase**, Maazim delivers a streamlined, user-friendly solution that enhances event planning and elevates the overall guest experience.

As part of the **SWE455 - Software Maintenance and Evolution** course, we applied refactoring techniques to improve the codebase.

## Maazim Refactoring 

### 1. Source Code Before Refactoring
- The main project branch (`Maazim-Main`) contains the original source code, including a folder named `AfterRefactoring`.

### 2. Source Code After Refactoring
- The `AfterRefactoring` folder contains the refactored version of the source code.
- Key improvements include:
  - **Meaningful variable names.**
  - **Redundant code removal.**
  - **Unused imports cleanup.** 
  - **Code readability and structure optimization.**

## How to Explore the Code

1. **Before Refactoring:**
   - Navigate to the `lib` folder.

2. **After Refactoring:**
   - Navigate to the `AfterRefactoring` folder.
